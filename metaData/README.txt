The results order is WRMS, white noise and flicker noise amplitudes, respectively.
Variance components estimation method is used to estimate the noise amplitudes.
All periodic harmonics stated in Bogusz and Klos 2016 were introduced to the weighted
least-squares estimation.

One can add more results or change the results in the "results_[comp].txt" by caring 
the order mentioned above.
