usage: conv2tse.py [-h] -fname FNAME [FNAME ...]
                   [-fromWhich [{gipsy,gamit,bernese}]]
                   [-comp [{all,east,north,up}]] [-offset OFFSET [OFFSET ...]]

conv2tse -> Converts to [?].tse file.

The script converts the time series or coordinate files produced by GPS/GNSS software
such as Gipsy-Oasis II, GipsyX, Bernese, and Gamit/Globk into its own format. It has
two main part including a header beginning with "*" and an observation part. In the 
observation part, the time label located at the end. That's why the GCTS_1.0 allows
one to use any of date formats which are year, month, day [yyyymmdd], modified julian
date [mjd], year and day of year [yearANDdoy], GPS week and day of week [gweekANDdow],
and decimal year [decimalYear].

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -fname FNAME [FNAME ...]
                        Original time series file supplied by a user to be
                        converted to the suitable time series format (i.e.
                        [?].tse file)
  -fromWhich [{gipsy,gamit,bernese}]
                        From which source, a GPS/GNSS data processing
                        software, an original time series has been created.
                        For instance, Gipsy-Oasis, GipsyX, Bernese,
                        Gamit/Globk etc.
  -comp [{all,east,north,up}]
                        Which GPS component will be taken from the original
                        time series and be converted to the *.tse format (i.e.
                        east, north, up, or all)
  -offset OFFSET [OFFSET ...]
                        Offset(s) date. The date format has to be same with
                        specified format by -dateFormat argument. For multiple
                        offset entries, -offset print("Something went wrong!")
                        argument has to be defined just before offset date.
  -unit UNIT UNIT       The argument has two variable. The first one is the
                        unit of the original time series file, and the other
                        is that of output file. The unit variables must be two
                        of mm, cm, dm, m, km.
  -dateFormat [DATEFORMAT]
                        Date format is specified the time label in the output
                        time series file. It could be any of the format listed
                        in discription above.
  -siteID SITEID [SITEID ...]
                        4-digit site IDs to be extracted. If source file from
                        gipsy, this argument could not be specified, that's
                        why site ID is extracted from filename.

*** EXAMPLES ***

---------
:: Ex1 ::
    Original file is from GipsyX software, the series unit is meter, it has also an
    offset happened at 2014 1 1. Let the desired unit milimeter, dateFormat yyyymmdd,
    and all GPS component included for the station TEST.

    conv2tse.py -fname TEST.series -offset 2014 1 1 -unit m mm -dateFormat yyyymmdd

        ===================================================================
        conv2tse.py is running and using the parameters:
        ===================================================================
            filename : TEST.series
           fromWhich : gipsy
           component : all
              offset : 2014 1 1
                unit : m mm
          dateFormat : yyyymmdd
        ===================================================================

        TEST.tse file has been created...

    NOTE: As clearly seen in the command, although -fromWhich and -comp arguments have
          not been introduced in the command line, they are set default as gipsy and all,
          respectively.

---------
:: Ex2 ::
    An additional offset at 58605, only for east component, and date format as modified
    julian date [mjd] in addition to the example above.

    conv2tse.py -fname TEST.series -offset 56658 -offset 58605 \
                -unit m mm -dateFormat yyyymmdd -comp east

        ===================================================================
        conv2tse.py is running and using the parameters:
        ===================================================================
            filename : TEST.series
           fromWhich : gipsy
           component : east
              offset : 56658
              offset : 58605
                unit : m mm
          dateFormat : mjd
        ===================================================================

        TESTeast.tse file has been created...

    NOTE: As stated in description of -offset argument, each of offset should be
          introduced under -offset argument. Moreover, the date format should be
          overlapped with the specified -dateFormat.
