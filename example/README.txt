The Geodetic time-series used in the Ex[?] directories represents simulated
campaign set-ups. For the 1st and 2nd example, the continuous time-series were
downloaded from https://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/JPL_GPS_Timeseries/repro2018a/post/point/.
As for the example 3, The Gamit/Globk solutions were obtained from Duman and Sanli (2019).
